# Cosmecode_dev_challenge
Small dev challenge for internship in Cosmecode (about python and git)

1. FizzBuzz Test (Python)
Instructions: Write a Python program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples
of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of five, print "Buzz". For
numbers that are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".
2. File Handling in Python
Instructions: Write a Python script that takes a text file as input (assume the text file is in the
same directory as your script). Your script should count the number of lines, words, and
characters in the text file. For simplicity, you can consider a word as a sequence of
characters separated by spaces.
3. Working with Remotes and Conflicts (Git)
Instructions: In your repository, create a new branch named "intern-task-4". In this branch,
add a file named "conflict.txt" and write "Hello, world!" in it. Commit and push the changes.
Now, switch back to the "main" branch and add a file with the same name "conflict.txt", but
this time write "Hi, world!" in it. Commit the changes. Try to merge the "intern-task-4" branch
into "main". Resolve any conflicts that arise, commit the resolved file, and push it to the
repository.
4. Pandas and NumPy (Python)
Instructions: You are given a CSV file named "data.csv" that contains three columns:
"Name", "Age", and "Score". Your task is to write a Python script using pandas that reads
this file and calculates and prints the mean and median of the "Score" column. Additionally,
use NumPy to calculate the standard deviation of the "Score" column. (the CSV file is
attached).
5. Rev Alpha (Python)
Make a program that takes a string as an argument, reverses it, swaps the case of its letters,
and prints the result.
• If more than one argument is provided, merge them into a single string with each argument
separated by a space character.
• If no argument is provided, do nothing.
