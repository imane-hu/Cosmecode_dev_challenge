Hello Imane,
Welcome to Cosmecode! We're excited to have you on board and look forward to seeing
your potential.
Before we start with the actual work, we have a small challenge for you. This will not only
help you get comfortable with the kind of work we do but also allow us to understand your
coding and version control skills.
For this challenge, you are required to create a public repository on your GitHub profile. All
the solutions for the tasks should be committed to this repository. We would like to see your
understanding of Git, your commit messages, how you structure your work, and your coding
style. Make sure to create appropriate branches for each task, commit often with clear,
descriptive messages, and merge your changes back to the main branch when you're done
with each task.
Once done, please send us a link to your repo.
You can use Python 3.7 or above to solve the exercises.
For each Python exercise, you are expected to create a test.py file to prove that your code
works.
